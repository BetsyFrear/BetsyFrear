- 👋 Hi, I’m @BetsyFrear
- I’m interested in learning all I can about Linux, the various distros and ways to use them, various applications, and Linux on mobile devices.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about vpn, vps, vm workstations, bash, scripting, and command line, then as much about coding as I can, in C, Java, Python, and more.
- 💞️ I’m not quite ready to collaborate yet.
- 📫
